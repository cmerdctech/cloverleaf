A LightningPipe client is...

Authentication parameters

List of API profiles (eg, UFF), each consisting of three things:
	1) server type (file or mssql), location and credentials (eg, etl or SFTP)
	2) server schema profile (eg, lpSchema or uffFlat1)
	3) data dictionary (eg, studentPlansInitial)

Perhaps no longer relevant, 'dataAccessAvailable' allows or prohibits access to existing data for this client for each defined API.


A Cloverleaf profile is...
